**How to approach the question?**

- Ask clarifying questions.
- Draw diagram if that helps, confirm this is what is expected.
- Explain the approach to Interviewer. If you know multiple, explain both and why you are choosing one over the other. Explain in terms of time and space complexity.
- Once Interviewer agrees with the approach, define some basic test cases i.e validation etc.
- Check with him, if we are good to start on the code.
- Try to make your solution generic, for ex, in case of Linked List, don’t just make your solution for Integer or just string. Better to have it generic, though it comes with extra overhead of custom comparator, but that’s ok.
- You can check with Interviewer that you are thinking of a generic solution, and if that would be ok to implement.
- Keep talking aloud in whole process. Keep interviewer engaged. 
- Once you are done with the solution, run through it once again and place appropriate comments. That way you will have a better commented code and you will revise the approach as well. Keep interviewer engaged here. Go step by step and revise what is happening.
- Run through the test cases you defined initially.
- If everything looks good, and you have covered all the test cases including some edge cases, step back and look at the code again. Don’t just say you are done. 
- Double check on method signature, input params, return type etc. 
- If that looks good too, we are done.
