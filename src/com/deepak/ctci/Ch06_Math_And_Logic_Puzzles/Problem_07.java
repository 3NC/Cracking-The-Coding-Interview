/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately 
 * concerned about the birth rate. Therefore, she declares that all 
 * families should ensure that they have one girl or else they face 
 * massive fines. If all families abide by this policy, that is, 
 * they continue to have children until they have one girl, 
 * at which point they immediately stop what will the gender ratio 
 * of the new generation be?. Assume that the odds of someone having 
 * a boy or girl is equal. Solve this logically then write a simulation of it.
