/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch,
 * which in addition to insert, find and delete, has a method
 * getRandomNode() which returns a random node from the tree.
 * All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen. Design and
 * implement an algorithm for getRandomNode(), and explain how
 * would you implement the rest of the method.
