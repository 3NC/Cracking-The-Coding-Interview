/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * T1 and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1
 * much bigger then T2. Create an algorithm to determine
 * if T2 is a subtree of T1. 
 * A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n
 * in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2.
 * That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two
 * trees would be identical.
