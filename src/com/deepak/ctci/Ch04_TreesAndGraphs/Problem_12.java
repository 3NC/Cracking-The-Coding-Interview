/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * You are given a binary tree in which each node contains
 * an integer value (which might be positive or negative).
 * Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that 
 * sum to a given value. The path does not need to start 
 * at root or end at leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling
 * only from parent node to child nodes) 
 *
