/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks
 * if one word is a substring of another. Given two
 * strings s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is 
 * a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring.
 * 
 * ex. "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat"
