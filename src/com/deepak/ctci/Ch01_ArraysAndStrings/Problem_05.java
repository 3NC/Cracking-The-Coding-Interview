/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * There are three types of edits that can be performed
 * on strings, insert a character, remove a character or
 * replace a character. Given two strings, write a function
 * to check of they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
 * 
 * ex. pale, ple -> true
 * pales, pale -> true
 * pale, bale -> true
 * pale, bake -> false
