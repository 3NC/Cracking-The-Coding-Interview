/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression
 * using the count of repeated characters. For ex. the string
 * "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the sum compressed string
 * does not become smaller then the original string, then your 
 * method should return the original string. You can assume that
 * the string has only upper case and lower case letters.
