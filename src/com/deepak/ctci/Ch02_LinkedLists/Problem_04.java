/**
 * <br> Problem Statement : 
 * 
 * Write code to partition a linked list around 
 * a value x, such that all nodes less then x
 * come before all node greater then or equal to x.
 * If x is contained within the list, the value of x
 * only need to be after the elements less then x (see below).
 * The partition element x can appear anywhere in the 
 * "right partition"; it does not need to appear between
 * the left and right partition.
 * 
 * Ex. Input : 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition = 5]
 * Output : 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
