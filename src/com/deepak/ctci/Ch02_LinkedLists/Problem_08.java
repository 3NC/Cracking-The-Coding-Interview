/**
 * <br> Problem Statement : 
 * 
 * Given a circular linked list, implement an 
 * algorithm that returns the node at the beginning
 * of the loop.
 * 
 * DEFINITION: 
 * Circular Linked List : A linked list in which a
 * node's next pointer points to the earlier node, so
 * as to make a loop in the linked list.
 * 
 * Ex. Input : A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [The same C as earlier]
