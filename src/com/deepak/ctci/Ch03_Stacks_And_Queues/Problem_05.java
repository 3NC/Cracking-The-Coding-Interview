/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items
 * are on top of stack. You can use an additional temporary stack,
 * but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure
 * (such as array). The stack supports the following operations:
 * push, pop, peek and isEmpty.
