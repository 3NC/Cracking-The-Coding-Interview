/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates
 * on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt
 * either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at
 * the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog
 * or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They
 * cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create a data
 * structure to maintain this system and implement operations such as
 * enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and dequeueCat. You may use the
 * built in linked list data structure.
