/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * Imagine a stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
 * Therefore, in real life, we would literally start a new stack when the
 * previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure,
 * SetOfStacks which mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several 
 * stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
 * SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a 
 * single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if
 * there were just a single stack.)
 * 
 * FOLLOW UP : Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop
 * function on a specific sub-stack.
